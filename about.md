I am a data engineer, computer programmer and system designer. My favoriate programming languages are Java and Python. I am also an entreprenuer and promoter of Women in Tech. I am proponent of Open Source and and have intiiated to open source many project at [Shoonye](https://github.com/shoonye){:target="_blank"}.  

I studied Textile Design and Fashion Technology and still interested in the subject. But my passions and love over the period have shifted to Computer Programming and it has greatly changed me as a person. 

In my free time I teach Python programming in Hindi to Women and Kids.
