I"Ž<p>I recently moved my website/blog from wordpress to Jekyll + Github Pages (I am still migrating). I love simplicity of both Jekyll and Gihub, that is the precise reson for the move. Wordpress is still awesome and best CMS, but for a simple website like mine, Jekyll and Github Pages are most efficient and cost effective. Making beautiful static website couldnâ€™t be any cheaper and easier.</p>
