<p>My first thank goes to my mother, who not only gave me birth but also despite all odds inspried and nurtured me to live a meaningful life.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks to my father for supporting me and believing in me. I would like to also thanks to amazing teachers, who help me out from follishness patiently, giving some advice and being nice to me and pulling me.</p>

<p>I am also thankful to everyone, who I have met in this life for sharing precious piece of their life with me!</p>

<p>Hopefully the knowledge that I got from them can be useful, and become a charity for them, Aamiin.</p>
