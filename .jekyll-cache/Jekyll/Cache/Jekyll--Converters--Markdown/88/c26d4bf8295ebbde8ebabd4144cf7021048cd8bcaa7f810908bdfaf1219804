I"-<p>Sometime you want to create a directory with upper limit on size in linux, this could be to restrict usage of a applicaiton or a user or for any other reason. There is no direct way to set limit on quota/size limit on a direcotry in linux. But as the saying goes, you can do anything on linux.</p>
