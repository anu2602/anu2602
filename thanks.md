My first thank goes to my mother, who not only gave me birth but also despite all odds inspried and nurtured me to live a meaningful life. 

My sincere thanks to my father for supporting me and believing in me. I would like to also thank all the amazing teachers, who patiently helped me out of my follishness and gave some of the best advice.

I am also thankful to everyone, who I have met in this life, for sharing precious piece of their life with me!

I am indeed thankful to you to read this page. Hopefully the knowledge that I got from everyone can be useful to others.
